# Readable
A React Redux project for my Udacity Nanodegree 3rd quarter project.

* [Api-server]() built by David Harris for Udacity.
* Frontend boilerplate provided by [Facebook Incubator](https://github.com/facebookincubator) [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

#Instructions
Start api-server on localhost:3001
```sh
cd api-server
npm install
node server
```

Start frontend application in separate terminal window
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

You should see the server running on [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3000/), and the application on [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) or whatever port you have selected.
